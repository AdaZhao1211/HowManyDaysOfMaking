# How Many Days of Making

How Many Days of Making is inspired by 100 Days of Making, a course in Interactive Telecommunication Program in Tisch School of the Art, NYU
I hope my own How Many Days of Making can consist more than one 100-day project.
I started with my first 100-day project on WEBGL explorations and experiments on March 27th, 2017.

### 100 Days of WEBGL explorations and experiments
 - Day1: Get a sense of fragment shader
 - Day2: Setup WEBGL developing environment and complete a triangle following [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB0ZVUrI4Aw)
 - Day3: Add some color following the same video
 - Day4: A bubble! [Tutorial](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/bubble_breakdown/) by Ken Perlin
